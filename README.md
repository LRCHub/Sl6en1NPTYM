```lrc
[00:08.40] I can read your mind
[00:15.80] "She's having the time of her life"
[00:23.21] There in her glittering prime
[00:25.32] The lights refract sequin stars
[00:28.23] Off her silhouette every night
[00:30.89] I can show you lies
[00:40.39] 
[00:37.28] Cause I'm a real tough kid
[00:39.37] I can handle it
[00:41.25] They said, "Babe, you gotta fake it til you make it."
[00:44.00] And I did
[00:44.83] Lights, camera and smile
[00:46.74] Even when you want to die
[00:48.76] He said he'd love me all his life
[00:52.19] But that life was too short
[00:53.98] Breaking down I hit the floor
[00:55.70] All the pieces of me shattered
[00:57.99] As the crowd was chanting "MORE!"
[00:59.46] I was grinning like I'm winning
[01:01.54] I was hitting my marks
[01:03.89] Cause I can do it with a broken heart.
[01:22.89] 
[01:09.19] I'm so depressed I act like it's my birthday
[01:13.13] Every day
[01:16.41] I'm so obsessed with him but he avoids me
[01:20.66] Like the plague
[01:23.99] I cry a lot but I am so productive
[01:27.97] It's an art
[01:31.39] You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
[02:03.39] 
[01:37.14] I can hold my breath
[01:44.20] I've been doing it since he left
[01:51.01] I keep finding his things in drawers
[01:53.99] Crucial evidence I didn't imagine the whole thing
[01:57.91] I'm sure I can pass this test
[02:12.41] 
[02:05.82] Cause I'm a real tough kid
[02:07.80] I can handle it
[02:09.64] They said, "Babe, you gotta fake it til you make it."
[02:12.55] And I did
[02:13.50] Lights, camera and smile
[02:15.32] In stilettos for miles
[02:17.42] He said he'd love me for all time
[02:20.85] But that time was quite short
[02:22.62] Breaking down I hit the floor
[02:24.47] All the pieces of me shattered
[02:26.50] As the crowd was chanting "MORE!"
[02:28.39] I was grinning like I'm winning
[02:30.15] I was hitting my marks
[02:32.58] Cause I can do it with a broken heart.
[02:51.58] 
[02:37.89] I'm so depressed I act like it's my birthday
[02:41.75] Every day
[02:45.04] I'm so obsessed with him but he avoids me
[02:49.24] Like the plague
[02:52.34] I cry a lot but I am so productive
[02:56.44] It's an art
[02:59.78] You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
[03:07.14] You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
[03:39.14] 
[03:14.81] You know you're good, and I'm good
[03:23.37] Cause I'm MISERABLE!
[03:26.52] And nobody even knows!
[03:32.82] Try and come for my job.
